    <h1> What is the most common color for deformity in M&ampM's? </h1>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p> 
     We collected data by first counting out how many of each color were deformed in a 2 lb bag of M&ampMs. We then measured their mass to see 
     how they compared to the average mass of an M&ampM. After that we went on a google sheet and recorded the color, the mass, and also the reason 
     why it was deformed.
    </p>

    <h2> Data Anaylisis</h2>
    <p>
    Some of the patterns we found were the deformed M&ampMs were usually dented. Out of 100 deformed M&ampMs 42 were dented while the second highest deformity 
    was cracked, at 25% of M&ampMs. We also found out that the average weight of unusual M&ampMs were 0.789g while the average weight of
    a regular M&ampM was 0.915g. Of all the colors we sampled we found that purple M&ampMs had the most deformities, coming in at 27 out of 100. In second place
    blue and green are tied with 21 deformities each.

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p>
    All in all this was a pretty fascinating experiment. Something pretty crazy we found out was that the most common color for 
    deformities was purple. Surprisingly the most common deformity was dented. Out of 100 deformities we found out that 42 of them 
    consisted of being dented. Second place goes to cracked, with having a total of 25 out of 100 meaning that first and second place
    both took over 67% of the deformities. One final but pretty important issue was the weight. The average or “perfect” M&ampM consists 
    of weighing in at around 0.92g, while the common weight of all of the deformities was lower coming in at just 0.78g showing that the 
    deformities are making a difference. In conclusion this was an overall fun experiment which gave me some key information when trying 
    to find the perfect M&ampM.
